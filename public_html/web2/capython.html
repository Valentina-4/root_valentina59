    <h2>Project Descrpiption </h2>
    <p>"Pathfinder" is a board game designed to encourage communication, self-expression, and meaningful connections. Through gameplay, participants share personal experiences while also listening to others. This game provides an opportunity to practice opening up about challenges and developing empathy for fellow players.</p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>A challenge for me was that it was a really big group of students. Group projects aren't my favorite and I tend to get stressed out and find communication more difficult the bigger the group is. When I saw our group was 9 people I got a bit overwhelmed.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <p>The solution to this is task dividing and clear communication. At the beginning of the week we had a group meeting and all talked about how we will divide the tasks. We made a group chat to easily communicate with each other, and also had a mid-week check in to see if everyone was on track. This made the whole process run smoothly and made me not mind a group project afterall.</p>

    <h2>Capyskills - HOS.1 - Manage My Work and Set Goals</h2>

    <h3>Before</h3>
     <p>I am currently at a level 4 in managing tasks and deadlines and setting goals. I am at this level because I have a hard time managing all of my responsibilities, but in the end I am able to complete all my tasks. I would like to be organized and have my priorities set so I know what to tackle when and how.</p>

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    <p>To achieve a higher level, I will use the “Time Management Matrix” which is 4 quadrants in which you must place your tasks in order by urgency and importance. This will help me manage my sports, school assignments, friends and family, and personal time. This makes it easy to see what truly matters and what you can completely delete.</p>
   
    <h3>After</h3>
    <p>I think I have leveled up because I now plan out each day the night before with a todo list, and have a weekly management matrix grid. This makes me feel less overwhelmed with everything I have to do and makes it easy to see my priorities.</p>

    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <p>As a group we divided tasks, which are available to view on the notion link, and I had to take on the cards. With Samia, we chose the colors, designed, wrote, printed and cut the cards out for our board game. Also, I wrote the game setup instructions, rules, and roles of game pieces. Lastly, I took some product photos that are on this site below. These pictures show the game in action, the pieces, and the design.</p>
